SafeVisionAI

SafeVisionAI is an advanced real-time visual monitoring and threat detection system designed to enhance safety for women. Leveraging computer vision and machine learning, SafeVisionAI analyzes live CCTV footage to detect potentially unsafe situations and immediately alert authorized personnel, including security staff or law enforcement. It also maintains a structured database of incidents for analysis and reporting.

Features

Real-Time Threat Detection: Monitors live video feeds and identifies unsafe situations using a trained ML model.

Automated Alerts: Sends instant notifications to admins, security personnel, or the police when threats are detected.

Incident Logging: Records events in a structured database for future analysis and reporting.

User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive dashboard for monitoring and reviewing incidents.

Scalable System: Can be integrated with multiple CCTV cameras for wide-area coverage.

Technologies Used

Frontend: React.js (Optional for dashboards)

Backend: Flask / Python

Computer Vision: OpenCV, TensorFlow / PyTorch

Machine Learning Model: CNN-based custom model for threat detection

Database: MySQL / MongoDB

How It Works

Video feeds from CCTV cameras are processed in real-time.

Frames are analyzed by a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect suspicious activities.

On detecting a threat, the system sends alerts and logs the incident in the database.

Admins or security personnel can review incidents via a dashboard.
